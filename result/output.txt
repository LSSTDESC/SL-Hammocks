# each row corresponds to 1 strong lens system
# i-th component, 0 = subhalos, 1 = satellite galaxy, 2 = host halos, 3 = central galaxy, 4 = perturbation (e.g. external shear)
# For lensed events only by host halos, [12-27] store -1, then please extract using e.g. np.extract(arr != -1, arr) for host halos events
# Above XX equals # of muliply image events in this "prefix_result.dat". To compare with ``gen_mock_mo10p", please filter flag_output = 1 or 3

[0]: number of images
[1]: original source i-band magnitude

[8]: flag_output
      - 1 for observable multiply image events in LSST (not limited by minimum image separation angle, but by magnitude, flux ratio and maximum separation)
      - 2 for singly/multiply image events with high mag. (max(mu)>flag_mag, default = 3)
      - 3 for observable multiply image events with high mag.
